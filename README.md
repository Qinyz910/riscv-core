# RISC-V Core Project

Welcome to the scaffold for a modular, open-source RISC-V core. This repository currently captures the project structure, documentation templates, and workflow entry points needed to begin development. As RTL, testbenches, and tooling mature, expand each section with the concrete details of your implementation.

## Project Goals
- Develop an educational yet production-capable RV32I (and beyond) core.
- Encourage clear separation between core logic, peripheral integrations, and verification assets.
- Provide reproducible simulation and testing flows across open-source and commercial toolchains.

## Repository Layout
| Path | Purpose | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `rtl/` | Source RTL for the processor and supporting blocks. | Seeded with `core/` and `peripherals/` subfolders for future expansion. |
| `tb/` | HDL testbenches and common verification components. | Organize reusable agents, BFMs, and scenario drivers here. |
| `sim/` | Simulator-specific harnesses, build scripts, and configuration files. | Includes placeholders for open-source and commercial flows. |
| `docs/` | Project documentation written in Markdown. | Populate `architecture.md`, `user_guide.md`, and `module_interfaces.md` as the design evolves. |
| `tests/` | Software payloads, regression definitions, and host-side test utilities. | Subdivide into unit, integration, and compliance suites as needed. |

Add additional directories (e.g., `fpga/`, `scripts/`, `tools/`) when they become relevant.

## Quick Start (Placeholder)
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <REPO_URL>
   cd <REPO_NAME>
   ```
2. **Install toolchains** – Document the required tool versions (RISC-V GCC, Verilator, VCS, etc.) in [`docs/user_guide.md`](docs/user_guide.md).
3. **Configure the environment** – Capture environment variables, license settings, and helper scripts once they are defined.
4. **Run a smoke test** – Provide canonical commands for building and executing simulation flows when available.

## Development Workflows (To Be Defined)
- **RTL Build & Lint:** Summarize Makefiles, scripts, or CI jobs responsible for linting and elaboration.
- **Simulation:** Detail how to launch Verilator, VCS, or other simulator back-ends and where to find artifacts.
- **Testing:** Define required regression suites and how they integrate with CI.

## Documentation Roadmap
- [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) – Capture high-level design intent, microarchitecture, and roadmap.
- [`docs/user_guide.md`](docs/user_guide.md) – Explain how to build, simulate, and contribute to the project.
- [`docs/module_interfaces.md`](docs/module_interfaces.md) – Specify the contracts between major hardware blocks.

Treat these files as living documents; update them alongside code changes.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Use feature branches and pull requests for all contributions.
- Keep RTL, testbenches, and documentation changes synchronized.
- Add regression tests alongside bug fixes or new functionality.
- Follow the project's coding style (to be documented) and reuse existing modules where possible.

## License
Define the project’s licensing terms here (e.g., Apache-2.0, BSD, MIT) before the first public release.
