# Module Interfaces

Document the inputs, outputs, and behavioral contracts for each significant RTL block. Use the sections below to maintain a consistent specification format.

## Top-Level Core Interface
- Describe clocking, reset, and global control signals.
- Enumerate instruction and data memory ports.
- Capture debug, interrupt, and trace interfaces.

## Pipeline Stage Boundaries
### Instruction Fetch → Decode
- List signal bundles exchanged between stages.
- Note timing assumptions and back-pressure behavior.

### Decode → Execute
- Detail operand routing, control signals, and hazard information.

### Execute → Memory
- Capture memory request interface widths, handshake semantics, and exception signaling.

### Memory → Writeback
- Document writeback data paths and result prioritization rules.

## Peripheral & Bus Interfaces
- Summarize peripheral attachment points (e.g., Wishbone, AXI-lite, custom buses).
- Include address mapping conventions and reset expectations.

## Configuration & CSR Interfaces
- Track configuration registers, CSR maps, and programming sequences.

## Verification Notes
- Provide assertions, protocol checklists, or scoreboarding expectations tied to each interface.
