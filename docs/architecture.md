# Architecture Overview

This document captures the high-level hardware blueprint for the RISC-V core. Populate each section as the RTL design progresses to ensure architectural intent stays aligned with implementation details.

## Design Goals
- Define the scope of the initial core (e.g., RV32I baseline, optional extensions).
- Summarize performance, area, and power objectives.
- Capture non-functional requirements such as portability, verification depth, and documentation expectations.

## Microarchitecture Summary
### Pipeline Stages
- Outline the planned pipeline structure (stage names, responsibilities, and key signals).
- Describe hazard detection, forwarding, and stall policies.

### Control and CSR Strategy
- Record how privilege levels, trap handling, and CSR accesses are organized.
- Note reset, clocking, and debug assumptions.

## Memory and I/O Architecture
- Document instruction and data memory interfaces, including protocols and timing.
- Describe peripheral attachment points and any shared bus fabrics.

## Configurability
- List parameterizable features (e.g., data width, cache presence, MMU enable).
- Explain how build-time configuration options will be expressed and validated.

## Verification & Validation
- Identify simulation environments, formal checks, and compliance test suites.
- Track coverage goals and sign-off criteria.

## Roadmap
- Capture future enhancements, experimental features, or research topics for investigation.
